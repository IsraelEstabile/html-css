            <h2>NICK WALKER'S SUPPLEMENT STACK</h2>
            <p>Nick kickstarts every workout with a serving Strawberry Kiwi BLOODSHOT non stim pre-workout, mixed with one serving of unflavored CDX Cluster Dextrin carbs and one serving of Orange Pineapple SILO[9] essential amino acids.</p>
            <h2>NICK WALKER'S LEG WORKOUT</h2>
            <h3>Seated Leg Curl</h3>
            <p>Nick likes to start his quad-focused leg workouts with a seated leg curl. He finds that this helps loosen up his knees more than doing leg extensions. Nick works his way up in weight each set until he gets to a working weight that allows him to reach failure at 10 reps. From there, he backs off the weight, performs two more sets of 10-15 reps, and focuses on squeezing and contracting his hamstrings each.</p>
            <h3>Leg Press</h3>
            <p>From the seated leg curl, Nick moves onto his first big compound movement for legs: leg presses. He positions his feet lower on the platform, about shoulder-width apart, while performing this exercise. Each rep is done under strict control, ensuring the weight does not bounce out of the bottom of the movement. He lowers the weight slowly and pauses briefly at the bottom of each rep. Then, he drives the weight up explosively, contracting his quads as hard as possible at the top. He works his way up in weight each set and takes one set to all-out failure at 30 reps.</p>
            <h3>Hack Squat</h3>
            <p>After the leg press, Nick moves on to hack squats. For this exercise, he positions his feet shoulder-width apart, near the bottom of the platform, to focus more on his quads. He lowers for a count of 3 before explosively driving the weight back up. He works his way up in weight each set, performing 5-6 reps per set to feel the weight out, then takes one set to all-out failure at 15 reps.</p>
            <h3>Leg Extension</h3>
            <p>Nick performs an FST-7 set for leg extensions. This technique involves a period of contracting a muscle followed by a period of having the muscle in a stretched position for a prolonged period. Nick picks a weight where he can complete 8-12 repetitions. He performs leg extensions to failure, returns to the bottom position, and stretches his quads in this position for 30-60 seconds before repeating this process four more times.</p>
            <h3>Adductor/Abductor Machine</h3>
            <p>Nick finishes off his leg day with three sets of 12-15 reps on the adductor (inner) and abductor (outer) thigh machines. He focuses on an explosive contraction followed by a controlled negative for both exercises. He is sure not to use his hands to push on his thighs to cheat the movement.</p>
